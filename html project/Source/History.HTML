<H2>Chand Dynasty</H2>

<P>It is believed that Bharti Chand, an ancestor of Gyan Chand, had replaced Bams, the ruler of Pithoragarh, 
after defeating them in 1445. In the 16th century, the Chand dynasty again took control over Pithoragarh town and, 
in 1790, built a new fort on the hill where the present Girls Inter College is situated. 
This fort was destroyed by the Indian government in 1962 after China attacked India.

The Chand rule, at its zenith, is seen as one of the most prominent empires in Kumaon. Their rule also coincides with a period of cultural resurgence. Archeological surveys point towards the development of culture and art forms in this period.
